# /delivery-big (Claude Code)

`/delivery-big` is the autonomous **large-task** delivery mode for Claude Code.

Canonical behavior lives in `docs/global-delivery-big-protocol.md`. This file is
the Claude Code adapter: it links to that protocol **and** repeats the
non-negotiable hard gates locally so they can never be dropped.

User input:

$ARGUMENTS
```

## Read first (source of truth order)

1. `docs/global-delivery-big-protocol.md` (canonical `/delivery-big` behavior).
2. `.claude/commands/delivery.md` (inherited `/delivery` rules).
3. `docs/global-command-protocols.md`, `docs/global-agent-settings.md`,
   `docs/global-project-adapters.md`.
4. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `package.json`, relevant product docs.

## 1. Purpose

- Inherits **all** normal `/delivery` rules.
- Built for **4+ independent requirements or 3+ task clusters**.
- Must **not silently drop requirements**.
- Runs a **verify-and-repair loop** before final reporting.
- Safe to run overnight for safe actions; stops for hard gates.
- Not a replacement for `/planner` (which creates/refines the issue). Not a
  weaker `/delivery`.

## 2. Inherit normal `/delivery`

Includes every `.claude/commands/delivery.md` rule: locate repo root; read setup
first; inspect repo state; branch from canonical base; respect scope/non-goals;
never commit secrets/`.env`/tokens/cookies/private data; scoped changes only;
preserve canonical baseline; run project checks; push branch; create/update PR;
report branch, PR, commits, changed files, and verification.

## 3. Project setup discovery (Reiki Yggdrasil)

- Find the Vite/React app root and `AGENTS.md` for `andylitvinov-design/reiki-yggdrasil`.
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `docs/global-command-protocols.md`, `docs/global-project-adapters.md`, delivery docs, and command files.
- Canonical repo `andylitvinov-design/reiki-yggdrasil`, branch `main`, default target `https://2mentalica.vercel.app`; secondary target `https://mentalica.vercel.app`; legacy URL `https://reiki-yggdrasil.vercel.app`.
- Use Reiki routing, auth-boundary, UI quality, and release-workflow rules. If setup docs are missing, add a `PROJECT ADAPTER GAP` section instead of guessing.

## 4. Autonomous no-confirmation mode

Do not stop for confirmation for safe actions: read files; create branch; edit
scoped files; install/build/test/lint/typecheck; start local preview;
browser/manual checks; commit; push branch; open/update PR; write
docs/checklists/tests in scope.

## 5. Hard gates (must stop)

Secrets/credentials needed; live money/payment actions; destructive production
data changes; deleting user/customer data; changing backend/provider config
outside scope; ambiguity that materially changes product direction; actions
requiring external account-owner approval. Mark the Task ID `BLOCKED`, keep safe
progress on other tasks, report the blocker.

## 6. Big prompt trigger

Use Task Manifest loop mode when: >3 independent tasks; OR >2 system areas; OR
autonomous/overnight loop requested; OR multiple comments/screenshots add
requirements. If invoked as `/delivery-big`, always use loop mode.

## 7. Context consolidation + Working Summary

Consolidate issue body, issue comments, linked PR comments, screenshots, project
docs/memory, and repo state. Do not rely only on the latest short prompt. For
very large issues, first write a compact `Working Summary` by Task ID (not
prose), keeping links to the original issue/comments.

## 8. Task Manifest (critical gate — required)

Extract every requirement into stable, human-readable Task IDs grouped by area,
each with **Source** tracking:

```md
## Task Manifest

TASK-CART-1: Remove phone/email/contact dropdown from Telegram-first cart form
Area: cart/order UX
Source: issue comment 2026-07-02 / screenshot
Status: TODO
Verify: mobile cart screenshot + DOM absence
```

Anti-drift: never silently change the manifest; append newly discovered
requirements as new Task IDs with source; split with parent/child IDs
(`TASK-CART-1a`); do not replace requirements with agent-preferred redesigns;
preserve owner preferences and screenshots over generic best practice.

## 9. Scope Contract (critical gate — required) + risk scoring

```md
## Scope Contract
Included Task IDs: - TASK-... (risk: LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
Excluded Task IDs: - TASK-... — reason
Non-goals: - ...
Likely files: - ...
Risk gates: - ...
```

Default: include all safe Task IDs. Exclude only if blocked, unsafe, or
explicitly out of scope — never just because it is time-consuming. Risk: `LOW`
UI/docs/test; `MEDIUM` data/parser/search/cart; `HIGH` payments/auth/backend/
storage/migrations/production data (gate or split HIGH unless explicitly
authorized).

## 10. Phase Plan

1. Low-risk UI/docs → 2. Data/model/parser/search → 3. Integration/backend (only
if scoped and safe) → 4. Regression tests/scripts → 5. Final full verification →
6. Repair iterations. Each phase ends with focused verification.

## 11. Verification Matrix (critical gate — required)

Every Task ID needs concrete evidence:

```md
| Task ID | Requirement | Source | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
```

Status: `PASS` (verified with evidence) / `PARTIAL` (partial or unverified) /
`BLOCKED` (needs creds/env/decision/hard gate) / `TODO` (not attempted —
unacceptable for DONE).

Evidence quality gate — good: `npm run build ✓`, screenshot filename+viewport+
route, DOM/script/test output, URL/path, redacted API response, file+component.
Weak (not PASS alone): "implemented", "should work", "visually checked" without
viewport/path, "tests pass" with no task-specific check.

State exactly: `Local checks:` / `Preview verification:` /
`Production verification: not run / run / blocked`. Do not claim production
behavior without checking live deploy after merge.

## 12. Repair Loop (critical gate — required)

Audit the manifest after first implementation. For each included `PARTIAL`/`TODO`
Task ID not genuinely blocked: repair → implement missing pieces → rerun focused
verification → update the table. **Default max 4 iterations.** Stop earlier only
when all included Task IDs are `PASS` or remaining ones are truly `BLOCKED`.

Budget behavior when running out of time/context: finish started tasks, keep repo
consistent, commit coherent progress, never hide unfinished tasks, status is
`PARTIAL` if any Task ID is not `PASS`, include the next prompt.

## 13. Self-review (before final report)

Re-read the original prompt/issue and pre-run comments; compare every requirement
to the manifest; check the diff for unintended files; confirm every Task ID has
evidence; run repair or mark `BLOCKED`/`PARTIAL` for anything missing.

## 14. DONE hard rule (critical gate — required)

**Never report `STATUS: DONE` unless every included Task ID is `PASS`.** Otherwise
`STATUS: PARTIAL` (meaningful work, not all passed) or `STATUS: BLOCKED` (no safe
progress). When not DONE, include a ready follow-up `/delivery-big` prompt.

## 15. Branch / PR / main drift

One PR per coherent big issue (split only to reduce risk, with a PR→Task-ID map).
Branch like `claude/delivery-big-<topic>`; phase-oriented commits; no unrelated
changes. Before final report: clean working tree (except documented artifacts),
branch pushed, PR created/updated, mergeability reported. If `main` drifted,
fetch/rebase/merge if safe, rerun checks, resolve in-scope conflicts only else
mark `BLOCKED`/`PARTIAL`.

## 16. Checks

Docs-only: inspect changed files; confirm no product source changed; run
markdown/lint if present, else report none exist. Product tasks: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test` if present,
`npm run build`, local browser/manual for UI, Vercel only when safe. Focused
checks per phase; full checks before final report; if full checks fail on
pre-existing issues, prove scope cleanliness with evidence.

## 17. Command discovery verification

```md
Claude Code:
- [ ] `.claude/commands/delivery-big.md` exists (this file).
- [ ] Filename is exactly `delivery-big.md`.
- [ ] References/inherits `.claude/commands/delivery.md`.
- [ ] Setup discovery points to the correct project root.
- [ ] If the command is not visible, restart Claude Code and verify project root.
Codex:
- [ ] `.codex/commands/delivery-big.md` exists (or `.codex/skills/delivery-big/SKILL.md`).
```

## 18. Final status line + report

Start the report with exactly one line: `STATUS: DONE` / `STATUS: PARTIAL` /
`STATUS: BLOCKED`. Then the Task ID table (section 11). Include checkpoints
(branch, latest commit, manifest statuses, remaining tasks, verification done)
and, when not DONE, the follow-up prompt.

## 19. Global rollout

Cross-project rollout, copy vs reference mode, adapter completeness check, and the
`GLOBAL ROLLOUT PROMPT` live in `docs/global-delivery-big-protocol.md`
(sections 26–28). Reference mode is the recommended default.
